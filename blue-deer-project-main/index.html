                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 1956, Redbud Cooperative in Von Cramm Hall is the largest cooperative house on campus. The recent addition of "Redbud" to the name commemorates the wooded area that used to be behind the building. Residents are a mixture of undergraduate and graduate students, and many are international or exchange students. The building was founded using gift funds from a donor with the hopes that the building would promote international understanding.</p>
                    <p>Officers are elected by members, and regular house meetings are held where members vote on house policies, on how to run and maintain the house, and on how to manage the community’s budget. Each resident shares responsibility for cooking, cleaning, and house maintenance.</p>
                    <p>Nightly dinners together help build community in the house, and residents regularly come together for social gatherings, game nights, and pool tournaments.</p>
