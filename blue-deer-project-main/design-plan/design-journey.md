# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is an inclusive housing community called Red Bud Cooperative @ Von Cramm Hall. We will be mainly working with Aisha Brunda, the president of the organization, along with other officers as our touchpoints for Red Bud and the official clients. Red Bud meets the client requirements as it is an on-campus organization that needs a static website. This website's target audience are people who are interested in learning about or joining the cooperative- it is not meant for people already a part of it, as community members already have their own internal communication methods. All group members are not allowed part of the client group.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.<br>
  Cooperative residential organization; a housing system for students of all backgrounds, a place accessible for everyone.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?<br>
  Red Bud is...
     - The largest co-op on campus: 34 people in the house.
     - Most diverse
     - Completely self-ran
     - Self-governing body
     - Organized community: everyone is helping the house
     - Similar to a commune
     - There is an officer team that runs everything
     - There are 40% gender diversity bounds through random selection process
     - Members include both grad and undergrad students (at least 2 grad students)

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?<br>
     1. There used to be a website for Von Cramm (old name of Red Bud), but it was very outdated (the contents in the website are either wrong or doesn't exist anymore).
     2. Red Bud wants to recruit new members who are interested in the co-op, but a lot of people don't know what this group does due to outdated website.
          - Ease Mosey process and make it easier for them to recruit people.
          - Less people are trying to move in during fall Mosey. Hard when the house is not at capacity bc of lack of rent money.
     3. Red Bud wants to advertise who they are: to have a website that attracts and eloquently introduces Red Bud to the audiences.
     4. Red Bud wants to update alumni via new contents and recent pictures on the website.
          - Red Bud wants a dedicated page on the website about new blurbs in order to get more donations for alumni and help them stay connected.

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?<br>
  The intended audience of this website is any Cornell student who wants to join the house and to learn more about the co-op & Red Bud. The secondary audience would be all alumni.

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?<br>
  They want website visitors to:
   - Come to open house, come to events, and apply.
   - Email Red Bud if they have questions
   - Join interest list. See if we can add SafePlate (weekly menu of food).

6. What are your goals for this site?<br>
   1. We want to showcase a lot of photos: pictures of rooms (doubles, singles, and living room etc) and possibly add newsletter for alumni.
   2. Exist and help Mosey by February. Makes it more legit.
   3. Include each separate contents for information about the meal plan, HIP (house improvement project) hours, requiremetns of being in the house, Rent information, current officers, stewards, and chores. This will rescue officers from repeatedly explaining all those basic informations countless times.

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?<br>
   - Color theme: orange, yellow, green etc (vibes: mostly neutral; fall & homey vibes)
   - Red Bud house logo: Possibily a line drawing of Red Bud forest tree imagery (references: sign outside & old merch)
   - Font: serif
   - Website will mostly have curved lines rather than sharp edges to give warm & homey vibe.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?<br>
  Typically news about it is spread through word of mouth, other coops don't really have websites and rely on Instagram.

9. Anything else to add?<br>
  Reference old website for content.

### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

Inroductions and met with Aisha. Then walked through project goals, restrictions, and the client questionaare to understand client goals. Finally, we visited the actual Red Bud cooperative and got a tour of the house.

### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (Firefox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site significantly that meets the project's requirements.

The website we intend to build will accurate capture of the vibe of Red Bud and co-op life in gneral. Our client has also indicated that they want the website to contain specific information and serve as an introduction to the house.

Although Red Bud technially has a website, it was created under the co-op's old name Von Cramm, and it is very outdated. We plan on desiging the website completely from stratch and only referencing the few valid information points present on the old website.

Below is a photo of the home page and a link to the website:
![Von Cramm hall website](image/von-cramm-website.png)
Source: <cite><a href="<https://jyoon926.github.io/Von-Cramm/index.html>">Von Cramm Cooperative Website</a></cite>


### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal 1: To teach potential new members about Mosey (when it is, how to paticipate, requirments etc)
- Goal 2: To teach potential new members about co-ops in general
- Goal 3: To showcase life in Red Bud (chores, HIPs, cook group, room pictures, etc.)


### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

This website is the right size for this project because the scope of it is to highlight living in a cooperative house. Living in such a place has many aspects, like the rooms, accomodations, amenities, etc. In addition, the house has an application process so that will need to be highlighted, as well as events that the house puts on. The scope of one house (as opposed to all co-ops) makes it not too big, but the various aspects of living in Red Bud make it not too small as it will be reasonable to divide living in the house up into smaller pieces.


## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the site's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

We will meet on Saturdays (a day that works of the majority of the team). We have also created a Google doc to track everyone's contributions and make sure that we all doing work and checking each other's work. We plan to do user interviews during mosey (dates will come soon, they are still being determined). We will assemble the content during milestone 2 (most of our content already exists, it just needs to be pulled from various places). We also plan on assigning tasks to each person to do at the end of meetings. This way everyone is held accountable. We don't have  hard dates of  when  we will  meet  as  everyone's  schedule's vary widely from week to week. This scheduling will occur at the end of each meeting.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality, but it doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Learn about the physical appearance and amenities in Redbud

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Photo gallery or carousel to show rooms and their types
  - Create and include a logo with red-bud's outward appearence as a line drawing
  - Make a specific page featuring all of the amenities

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes.**

In order to effectively demonstrate the physical appearances of Redbud, photos are necessary in order to provide a visual understanding to the users about what Redbud looks like. Thus, putting interactivity that will show many different photos intuitively will be crucial, which is why we will have a photo gallery and/or carousel. The logo will further reinforce the visual branding of the co-op. Finally, by centralizing all of the amenities on one page, it will make it the relevant information very easy to find and access.

Goal 2: Learn culture of co-op and vibes of residents

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include an "Officers" page with their photos
  - Show off candid photos
  - Rules list

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._

The leadership of an organization dictates the internal culture and expectations, so it is crucial that it is easy for users to meet and understand who are the officers of Redbud. Thus, we will pull a speciifc page with all officer contact information and their photos so that audiences can better "vibe-check" the organization as a whole. The candid photos around the website will also show the fun and activities the co-op does. Furthermore, by specifically listing out the expectations and rules that the co-op has for its members, it makes the collaborative culture of the co-op to the forefront.

Goal 3: Learn logistics of living here (cost, expectations, rules)

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Show cook group photos
  - Describe co-op expectations
  - Including logistic information

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._

Displaying cook group photos will visualize the logistics of life at Redbud. Since cook group is a weekly requirement, showcasing that among other clearly outlined co-op expectations on the website will help put all potential moseyers on the same page. In order to communicate the logistics of living at Redbud, the main design choices is to include crucial information through text content and organizing it in an intuitive and user-centered way on different pages.

Goal 4: Learn what Mosey is and how to join

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - List requirements to Mosey
  - Show more fun photos
  - List Mosey events

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._

In order to achieve this audience goal, we will clearly list the requirements to mosey, with relevant links included right in the text so it is easy to access. Furthermore, including more fun photos will allow potential Moseyers to get a better sense of the process and become more excited about the co-op. Finally, clearly showing the Mosey events in a list format will make it easy to read for the audience.


### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

The audience for this website is prospective Moseyers (applicants) of Red Bud. This audience is a cohesive group because it is a group with similar interests and goals--people looking for housing in a co-operative house. They want to know what living in the house is like and what the amenities are like and the website is tailored to showcase the house and living in it. It is primarily an outreach website for people who do not live in the house but are interested in living in the house.


## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://prospectofwhitby.weebly.com/>

    ![Whitby narrow](image/Whitby-narrow.png)

    ![Whitby wide](image/Whitby.png)

2. <https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~chauncey/?_ga=2.80765840.624270411.1699221046-1628570088.1699221046>

3. <https://tpcooperative.wixsite.com/twinpines>

    ![Twin Pines narrow](image/Twin-Pines-narrow.png)

    ![Twin Pines wide](image/Twin-Pines.png)


### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The Prospect of Whitby website follows some common design patterns like a navigation bar. In addition, some pages are well-designed. The entire website follows a common color scheme. There is not much interactivity besides a contact form and drop down menu on the navigation bar in wide and a hamburger button in narrow. It is responsive to wide/narrow design. However, there are inconsistencies in text alignment between pages.


### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The Chauncey website is well-designed, with a consistent theme. It has interactivity in the nav menu by jumping to different places on the page. It features a carousel on the top of the page. The website is responsive but stacks images making the website really long. Overall though it is a well-designed website.


### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The Twin Pines website has an effective visual theme however it is not well-designed. There is an inexplicable blank area when the page first loads, forcing one to scroll down for the content. This also leads to a lack of apparent feedback when one clicks on the nav menu. The website is not responsive to narrow designs either. There is some interactivity through seeing image titles when hovering but overall the website is not very well designed


## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)
> Briefly summarize the content; do not include the content here.

- Contact Information
- Photos of different types of rooms
- Photos of common rooms
- Text about Red Bud + coop living
- Responsibilities
- Room Types
- History
- Why Red Bud
- What is Mosey
- Mosey Events
- Selection Process
- Meal Plan
- Red Bud Constitution Link
- Photos from socials
- Photos from house responsibilities
- Candid photos of Red Bud Members
- Housing Rates
- Names of Officers + descriptions
- Photos of officers
- Save Plate Link


### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

We have carefully curated the website content to successfully meet all four goals that we have outlined for the audience. To reiterate, the goals are for the audience to overall learn, specifcally about the physical appearance and amenities in Redbud, the culture of co-op, vibes of residents, logistics of living at Redbud (cost, expectations, rules), what Mosey is, and how to join. Thus, we have obviously included all of the relevant text content to answer those initial questions, and organized them in appropriate pages so that the information will be easy to find. In order to effectively communicate the details about Redbud, photos of the house will be placed all over the website. Some specific additional pieces of content that weren't used to directly address the audience goals such as Save Plate and Contact Information have been included to supplement the audience's understanding of Redbud and advance client goals. For example, a link to Save Plate is crucial as Moseyers need to put their allergies in if they choose to visit Redbud and also shows them what kind of food Redbud serves on their dining plan. Furthermore, contact information is important as if they have any other questions, they need a clear way to contact Redbud officers for answers.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![Card sort iteration 1](image/cards1.jpeg)
The first iteration ended up being similar to the final iteration, but ultimately funnelled too much to the other pages, leaving the home page with a dearth of content.

The Mosey page offers an overview of co-op calling information on Mosey and Red Bud. It includes details about events hosted and social media pictures, presenting a snapshot of the co-op. The home page serves as a comprehensive landing point, providing a history overview and contact information. A dedicated page on co-op living is essential, as not everyone may be familiar with this living format. Consolidating all relevant information on one page facilitates audience goals by providing easy access to the necessary content.

![Card sort iteration 2](image/cards2.jpeg)
The second iteration balanced a little bit better, but still left the home page with too little content.

The Mosey page not only furnishes information about Mosey and Red Bud but also addresses any follow-up questions that users may have after reading the content on the same page. This includes details on how they can join, which is covered through content on selection, and the associated costs, a defining factor for those considering living in the space.

The Amenities page consolidates all logistical information into a single page, emphasizing the technical details of Rose Bud. This encompasses room types, meal plans, and photos of both common and other rooms.

![Card sort iteration 3](image/cards3.jpeg)
The third iteration approached content balancing differently by spreading content out across more pages but ultimately left each page with too little content that it would become frustrating for the user to switch between pages.

Meal and housing information are presented on separate pages, acknowledging the distinct aspects of the co-op. This intentional division prevents users from feeling overwhelmed by different types of information, allowing for a more focused and organized user experience. The footer, employing a commonly used design pattern, features easily accessible contact information.

![Card sort iteration final](image/cards-final.jpeg)
The final iteration balances content while sorting them off into appropriate sections. A more detailed justification is found below.

The home landing page comprises introductory text about Red Bud and co-op living, alongside a history section providing relevant context. This equips the audience with the necessary information to comprehend and navigate the rest of the webpage. The candid picture of the officer is strategically placed to capture users' attention, redirecting their focus to content that aids them in achieving their goals, leveraging the inherent human appeal of faces.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

We will use the last iteration.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

The final organization of content is appropriate for the audience because it sorts the website into the appropriate categories that a person interested in applying to or learning more about Redbud Cooperative would be interested in. For instance, the rules page details the constitution and the other details of the house, the mosey page details facets related to the application process, the amentities page details what the house has to offer, and the officers page lists the officers with contacts for further questions.

The homepage provides introductory text about Red Bud and cooperative living, accompanied by a history section that offers essential context. This equips visitors with the information needed to comprehend and navigate the rest of the webpage, aiding them in achieving their goals of understanding the co-op culture. A strategically placed candid photo of a resident officer captures users' attention, guiding them to content that assists in achieving their goals by leveraging the inherent human appeal of faces. Content pertaining to the rules and responsibilities of the house, a defining component of cooperative housing, is carefully organized on its own dedicated page. This aids users in addressing their goals of learning the logistics of living in a co-op. The Amenities page consolidates all logistical information into a single page, emphasizing the technical details of Red Bud, including room types, meal plans, and photos of common and other rooms. This approach helps users fulfill their needs of learning about Red Bud's amenities in one convenient place. The "What is Mosey" page serves to distinguish Mosey from Red Bud. With content logically sorted into relevant groups for clarity and ease of navigation. This ensures that visitors seeking specific information can easily find what they need.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- Rules
- Mosey
- Amenities
- Officers

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

The five pages that we have selected to make will be just enough to seperate all the content relatively evenly, and the names of them are clear and concise, effectively communicating what will be on each page to the user. For the home page, we have named it Home, but will actually be representing it with a clickable image of Redbud. This will make sense, as this is a common design pattern seen in many sites, where you can access the home page by pressing the logo. All the names of the pages are a single word, so that they are easy to read, and is the main idea of that page.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

After visiting Redbud cooperative in person and talking with our client, we have decided on a theme that will effectively communicate the aesthetic and overall vibe of the co-op to the target audience (people who are interested in potentially joining the co-op). In terms of color, we decided to majority use a dark red, black, adn white. This is heavily inspired by what the outside of the house looks like, so that Red Bud can provide a cohesive image of what the place looks like Imagery is crucial to this website, as good photos are the fastest way of showing off a house and community. All over the entire website, we have photos of everything, from the rooms, outside of the co-op, community members, events, and more, which all serve purpose to supplement the written content of the website and improve the user's understanding.


## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Clickable photo gallery to show bigger versions of room types
- Hamburger menu for narrow display
- Toggle to show more information about each type of room


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![Layout Exploration-wide](image/layout-wide.jpg)
The website's color theme is mainly conists of off-white and dark red colors. Both the header and footer will be a dark red color and rest of the background will be off-white. The overall vibe of the website will be a simple giving more emphasis on features with bold color (red). We are going to be using sarif font to give more casual feeling into the website as it is aiming to approach the user in a more friendly way than professional websites. The Redbud building logo will be the eye-catching component, making the website more interesting to capture user's attention. And as shown in the sketch, we will be implementing side-bar interactivity for pictures to further develop the website in a way that users will be satisfied.

![Layout Exploration-narrow](image/layout-narrow.jpg)
The design layout for the narrow will be very similar to the wide but the only difference will be the layout and image sizes. The main image in the sketch will be musch narrower. And the text will all be narrowed so it can fit the narrow width. Other than the size difference, the color theme, redbud building icon and font family will still remain the same.

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Please provide an explanation for each sketch.


**Wide Design:**

**index**
![Final Design index-wide](image/finalsketchw-index.jpg)
The website for all pages have dark red color background for menu bar and footer along with white color font. And all the text inside these two sections will be grouped in a row.

   The index page for wide screen will have a main cover image right beneath the menu bar (positioned center). And first two contents (Welcome message; and 'Why Redbud?' contents)are grouped together in a row. And another two contents (History content; and Life of Redbud gallery interactivity content) will also be grouped in a same way. Ultimately, these two groups will be grouped in a column form (stacked vertically).

   To go specifically into the gallery interactivity in teh Life of Redud content, we have used carousel to display image consecutively when button is pressed. So, when the button on the right side is pressed, the image on the right side of the displayed image will be displayed. And if the left side button is pressed, the image on the left side of the displayed image will be displayed. If users keep pressing one side of the button consecutively, the image will eventually rotate and come back to the first image that was displayed (it is a cycle of image).

**amenities**

   The officers page for wide screen has total 10 images of officers. These 10 pictures are grouped in two groups of five pictures each. And each group is grouped in a row. Finally, these two groups are organized in a column.


**Narrow Design:**

**hamburger**
![Final Design hamburger-narrow](image/finalsketchn-hamburger.jpg)
The website for all pages have dark red color background for header bar and footer along with white color font. And for the narrow screen, the menu bar is hidden inside a hamburger icon interactivity and the texts in the footer are grouped in a column.

   The hamburger menu bar interactivity is a toggle button. When the hamburger menu is clicked initially, the list of five rows for each page will pop down. And when the hamburger icon is clicked once more, the nnavigation menu list will disappear.

### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

The design is appropriate for the audience of those interested in living in Redbud. The website's content appeals to someone who doesn't live in the house. The home page contains general information about the house and photos. The amenities page contains details about the housing and meal plan. The rules page contains an overview of responsibilities and the constitution. The mosey page details the application process and lists events, and the officers page lists officers with photos if one has specific questions.

The website contains a header with a navigation bar, uses carousels, has a footer, and breaks content into sections. It is a familiar design pattern that many websites utilize. Additionally, the content is framed in a 1400px box. At that breakpoint, the header and footer continue across the page visually but all the text content is framed within 1400px. This creates a modern design seen on many websites, unlike framing the website only to appear in a certain area with sidebars that stand out (which is an old design pattern). The website uses centering sparingly and overall aims to provide a friendly, familiar design.

## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

The website will include a hamburger button in the narrow version of the website, as well as carousels on the home/amenities pages and opening/closing panes on the amenities panes. The panes address the goal of learning the logistics of living here as people interested in different rooming situations can see what is relevant to them and not what is irrelevant. Carousels not only draw audience attention but also optimize the limited screen space . The carousel also help show all images in one place.  The carousels support the goal of displaying the vibe of the co-op by showing multiple images without cluttering the page with images. Navigation takes up a lot of space, we don’t want it to be the first thing people see when they access a website. We use the hamburger menu to hide the navigation menu until it's necessary. We show navigation when a user needs it and once they are done they can close it so it's not taking too much space. It also takes the user faster to the primary content on the website.  We want to show the users the main content right away and not bury it below that menu. This enhances the functionality.  The hamburger menu also enhances the experience on narrow displays as it makes the buttons more accessible.


## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

or the hamburger button, there will be a "narrow" header and a "wide" header. The narrow header will be in a div with the id "mobile-header" and class "hidden" by default. The breakpoint will be at 700px. At that point, the wide header (nav id="nav-menu") will be hidden and the narrow one displayed. The wide header is the default initial state. The psuedocode is roughly:

```
on page load:
   if width < 700:
      hide wide header (add class hidden)
      show narrow header (remove class hidden)
on page resize:
   if width < 700:
      hide wide header
      show narrow header
   else:
      show wide header
      hide narrow header
```

For the collapsable panes, there are buttons with the title of the pane, then a ul item with the id "*-info" that has the hidden class applied. On click of the button, it toggles the hidden class. Psuedocode for each button:

```
on click (button):
   if info is hidden:
      show info
   else:
      hide info
```

For the carousel, each carousel will have a few images. The first image will be displayed and the next one or previous one will be displayed on click of the appropriate button. Each slide will change every 10 seconds with no action. Psuedocode:

```
on click forward:
   hide current slide
   show next slide
on click backward:
   show current slide
   hide next slide
every 10s:
   hide current slide
   show next slide
```


## Client Feedback & Minutes (Milestone 2)
> You should meet with your client again to obtain feedback on your design.
> Provide a summary of the client's feedback and your meeting's minutes.

The client generally liked the website, they had some critques as listed below. They wanted the margins to be slighty bigger, felt that the nav bar was too thick, and that Redbud cooperative did not need to be put under the house. They wanted the image carousel to be automatic and smaller on the amenities page. Addtionally they also pointed out some typos that we will go and fix. Overall they like the website and are impressed with our work (we had the officers who are CS/IS majors evaluate it so they were very picky about what was going on and provided relevant feedback). They would like a line added under the nav element when you click on it so it is clearer when you hover or click on a page.

Meeting Minutes:
Met with officers, 11/14.

Met with multiple officers and let them explore the website and openly give their opinion. We asked some of the other officers instead of the president Aisha because she was very busy and we wanted to ensure the website represented Redbud as a whole. Client overall liked the website, had little compliants about the actual content and more about structual components. Had a relevant conversation about what might need to be updated and maintained every semester. Client reminded us that Redbud is one word, not two.

## User Testing (Final Submission)

**Conduct user testing with a minimum of 1 participant for every member of your team.**

### User Testing Tasks (Final Submission)
> Plan out your user testing tasks before doing your user testing.
> These must be actual user testing tasks.
> **Tasks are not questions!**

Given that our goals are:

- Goal 1: Learn about the physical appearance and amenities in Redbud
- Goal 2: Learn culture of co-op and vibes of residents
- Goal 3: Learn logistics of living here (cost, expectations, rules)
- Goal 4: Learn what Mosey is and how to join


We have decided on the following user testing tasks:

1. Find a photo of the exterior of the house, a photo of the interior of the house, and photos of individual room types available inside Redbud.
2. Locate the information (photos and text content) you need to understand the rules and culture of Redbud. Find how room selection works in the rules.
3. You are considering living at Redbud. Find the cost and description for the meal plan and housing.
4. You are interested in joining a co-op. Determine if you are eligible and locate the relevant resources you need to understand the joining process. Find two events you can go to.


### Participant 1 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

   The user is a graduate student studying Computer Science. Originally from the Midwest, they are currently engaged in research at Cornell University. Described as introverted, the user expresses a desire to connect with people in the community as they are new to Cornell.

2. Does the user belong to your audience of the site?

    > If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the audience?

   Yes, the user is considered part of the site's audience as they not only express an interest but are also eligible to potentially join the Redbud cooperative.

### Participant 1 -- Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test.

Task 1. Find a photo of the exterior of the house, a photo of the interior of the house, and photos of individual room types available inside Redbud.

- The first photo on the home screen featured the exterior of the house. As they scrolled down, a variety of room photos within the house quickly caught their attention. They then intuitively clicked through the life at Redbud photo carousel.
- Moving to the "Amenities" section, they explored a photo carousel displaying different rooms. However, it was noted that the photos lacked labels specifying the types of rooms presented.

Task 2. Locate the information (photos and text content) you need to understand the rules and culture of Redbud.

- Noticed rules at the top of the page in the navigation bar and decided to explore. Clicked on it, scrolled through the table of contents, and clicked through the drop-down buttons.
- Did not click on the blue links to navigate through buttons with dropdown information. After some extended clicking through all the buttons, eventually found the room selection process.
- Explored other pages like Amenities and Mosey to gather more information on the co-op.

Task 3. You are considering living at Redbud. Find the cost and description for the meal plan and housing.

Promptly accessed the amenities page, having noticed it earlier in task 2. With minimal scrolling, she efficiently obtained information on the cost and description of the meal plan and housing.

Task 4. You are interested in joining a co-op. Determine if you are eligible and locate the relevant resources you need to understand the joining process. Find two events you can go to.

Given the user's prior discovery of what Mosey was in task 2, she immediately clicked on the Mosey tab. As she scrolled down the page, she quickly found information on eligibility and listed events. However, she expressed confusion about whether grad students were allowed.

Final Actionable Takeaways and Suggestions:

- Consider renaming the "Mosey" navigation item to something more intuitive, such as "Join," to enhance clarity for users unfamiliar with Mosey.
- Improve the clarity of the amenities page by either providing brief descriptions in parentheses on the single, double, triple expansion buttons or reconsider the necessity of these expansions. The single, double, and triple expansion buttons are challenging to comprehend because they lack descriptions indicating the content within the expansion.
- Clearly communicate whether grad students are eligible for Mosey on the dedicated Mosey page to avoid user confusion.
- Enhance user experience by adding captions to photos of rooms, indicating the room type associated with each photo. This will provide users with clear and concise information.

- Consider changing the term "Mosey" to more accessible language.
- Evaluate the removal of buttons on the Amenities page, as they contribute to the difficulty in finding information


## Website Revision Based on User Testing (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?

On the amenities page, the accordions for each room type were removed as users found it frustrating and it did not make the page more usable. Additionally, the mosey page was renamed to join in the navigation, as someone not familiar with the co-op system will not know that mosey means to join. These suggestions showed up in nearly all of our user tests and clearly were the most pressing changes to make. Captions were not added to the room carousel, as the idea was to give a sample of, not represent each room type (and suitable photos were not available for each type due to privacy concerns of residents)
