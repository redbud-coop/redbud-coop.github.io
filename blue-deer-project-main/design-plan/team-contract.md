# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Design a functional website
    - Pull our weight and do the assigned tasks we are given
    - Communicate via the group chat often
    - Assign each member a specific role so everyone puts in effort
    - Keep GitHub and team tracker sheet up to date with our changes
       - <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CXWvwJnSt42kEg-ZRwuejt2xqnkGgTvGCof1pKKwQLI/edit?usp=sharing>

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Respect one another always
    - Honor our commitments to ourselves and each other
    - Hear each other out completely and DO NOT interupt each other

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - Communicate regularly in the group chat
    - Meet once at least once a week, absences/lateness will be communicated in the group chat

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - Maintain contact with Aisha and other officers of Red Bud Cooperative via email/in-person meetings
    - Emmy can serve as last resort if we really can't get in touch with officers/clients

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    - Submitter: one person will be responsible for submitting the assignment before the deadline after receiving confirmation from all team members that all changes have been pushed
    - Point of contact: one person will serve as the point of contact between the client and website team
    - Team documenter: one person will track progress on the active sheet and take meeting notes
    - Due Dilligence: one person will check over final milestones to ensure we finished all parts of it with the right specifications

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    - We will all agree to abide by this document and communicate with each other if changes are necessary
    - We will hold each other accountable by assigning specific tasks via the group Google Doc and updating the status of completion
    - We will confront members falling short/not contributing with grace but appeal to them out of fairness. We will ensure that they don't have anything preventing them from doing work and handle each case individually.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - We will hear each other out and attempt to achieve compromise; if no compromise is possible we will work with a majority opinion

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - As needed; it will be brought up during a meeting or in the group chat

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    - Take the project seriously but don't take ourselves too seriously!
    - Have fun and hopefully make friends along the way
    - We will get ice cream at the end of the project.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
